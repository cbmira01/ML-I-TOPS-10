        The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,
        But, swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,
        Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:
        Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
        Daily devours apace, and nothing said;
        But that two-handed engine at the door
        Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.
             - John Milton, "Lycidas" (1637)

Codes in this directory are the ML/I macroprocessor and the LOWL test suite
source codes that have been preprocessed to look like MACRO-10 macro calls. 

    [LABELS] have been recast to LABELS:
    Stanzas needed for MACRO-10 have been inserted.

The idea is to recreate these files on the fly at build-time.

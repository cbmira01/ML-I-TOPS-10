- Explain what these files are:
    LOWL source for ML/I macroprocessor, ver AJB
    LOWL source for LOWLTEST, ver L4A
    ML/I test suite, ver T2A

    These files are as-distributed state

- Explain where these files came from:
    http://www.ml1.org.uk/implementation.html

- Explain conversion of LOWL-macro programs into MACRO-10 programs.
    'quoted strings' into "quoted strings"
    [LABLES] into LABLES:
    BEGIN:: label made EXTERNal
    Variables that MDCODE expects to see in a LOWL program
    Additional stanzas needed by MACRO-10 (HEADER.MAC)

- Explain CLEAN, BUILD, TEST and DEPLOY steps.

- Explain HELLOW.MAC, the first sanity check.

- Explain LTEST4.MAC, a test of LOWL macro definitions.

- Explain VALMDL.MAC, a test of LOWL machine-dependent logic.

- Explain the T2A test suite for ML/I.

- Explore a conversion program to prepare LOWL source code for MACRO-10.
    Can MACRO-10 conditional compiling do this?

- TODO: Proper implementation guide.

- TODO: command scanner and file globber for the ML/I executable.

- TODO: character packing for better use of main memory.

- TODO: DECsystem HLP: and DOC: files.

- TODO: CI/CD pipeline that delivers a distribution on SIMH magtape.

- TODO: Proper target machine deployment script.

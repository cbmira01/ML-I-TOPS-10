- hworld.MAC is an absolutely minimal LOWL program, the first sanity check.

- valmdl.MAC is a test of the machine-dependent logic.

- Both of these programs should be recast as .LWL files and their conversion
  to .MAC be done on the fly at build-time.

- Include author attribution (CBM).

- Refer back to license information in the project root.
